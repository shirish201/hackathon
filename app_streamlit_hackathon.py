                 Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
                 But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

                With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
                
                **Goal**     
                It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 
                
                **Practice Skills**
                 - Creative feature engineering 
                 - Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
